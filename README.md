**Implementing OpenTelemetry in Azure Functions**

This repository demonstrates how to implement OpenTelemetry in Azure Functions to achieve full observability across your serverless workflows. It provides a hands-on example using the .NET isolated process model, enabling you to collect and export traces, metrics, and logs in a standardized way. With OpenTelemetry, you gain deep insights into the performance and reliability of your Azure Functions, supporting better debugging, monitoring, and optimization within a distributed cloud-native environment.
